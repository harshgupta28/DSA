DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING
    = choice + optimization
    
dp can be achived by memoization AND top-down approach

MEMOIZATION = RECURSION + USE OF MEMORY

TOP-DOWN 

no use of recursion bcoz in some cases stack of recurion may 
be very big which gives error (stack overflow error)

so we write iterative solution 
base case chnanges to initialization

how to think for base case - think for smallest valid input
